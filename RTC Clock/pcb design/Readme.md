The PCB has the DS3231 RTC IC integrated onto it and is controlled by ATmega328P microcontroller./
LEDs and switches have been used as indicators and controllers. These LEDs and switches have been placed on the PCB board but separate sets of headers have been added to draw wires when they need to be installed on an enclosure.
SMD LEDs, resistors and capacitors have been used to decrease the area size of the PCB.
The manufactured and assembled PCB's photographs are included in the drive link along with a demo.
